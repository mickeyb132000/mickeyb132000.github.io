<p>My name is Mikeya Brown, I was born and rasied in Miami, Florida. I moved to Boston for about three years, and returned finishing my education in Miami, Florida.
I entered the art world at the young age of five, while attending F.S. Tucker Elementary school. I remember the art teacher pulling me aside from the rest of the class, of course I thought I had done something wrong, then she began to ask me multiply questions about art.
Finally, she got to the point, "I think that you should go to a different school, then here. Have you heared of a school called South Miami Elementary Magnent school. I hadn't, but I was interested now.
From there I was she set up an audition for me, and I was accepted into the magnent arts program. After a few years, I returned back to my passion of art attending Miami International University for my B.F.A.
